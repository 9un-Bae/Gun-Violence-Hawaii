RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. What truly drives Hawaiis gun deaths — suicide or homicide?
  - Nationally, “gun violence” often means homicides or mass shootings,
  - but in Hawaii, suicides make up a much larger share of firearm deaths.
  - Reframes the issue from law enforcement → public health & mental health.

2. How are Hawaiis children and teens impacted by gun violence?
  - Per-capita, youth often face disproportionate risk despite low total counts.
  - Resonates with community and policy priorities (“Protect our keiki”).

3. Does Hawaii fit the national narrative of “mass shootings”?
  - National media focuses on high-profile shootings.
  - Hawaii rarely experiences them — instead, its more isolated, personal violence.
  - Understanding the difference helps policymakers set realistic priorities.

4. How does Hawaii compare nationally (per capita)?
  - Compare Hawaiis per-capita death and injury rates to the U.S. average.
  - Examine whether population size distorts perception of safety.

POSTER
Panel 1 - “The National Landscape”
  - Line graph: total U.S. incidents and deaths (2014-2024)
  - Map: per-capita gun deaths by state
  - Text: “Gun violence is widespread — but patterns differ sharply across states.”

Panel 2 - “Hawaii in Context”
  - Line chart: Hawaii vs. U.S. average per 100k deaths
  - Bar chart: Hawaii vs. Top 5 states per capita (e.g., Texas, Florida, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania)
  - Highlight: “Hawaiis firearm deaths are primarily suicides, not homicides.” (is this true)
  - Youth data callout: “Keiki represent a smaller portion of victims, but per-capita, the risk is rising.”

Panel 3 - “Looking Ahead: Prevention & Prediction”
  - Simple ML regression predicting Hawaiis firearm deaths for 2025-2027(e.g., linear regression or Prophet — lightweight & interpretable)
  - Visual: Forecast with shaded uncertainty region
  - Recommendations:
    - Increase mental health funding and crisis intervention
    - Encourage safe storage laws and community outreach
    - Strengthen data transparency between law enforcement and health agencies
  - Closing text: “Data shows Hawaiis battle isnt with mass shootings — its with unseen struggles behind closed doors.”
